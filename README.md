# About

Passalong is an alternative UI for donorschoose.org. It's primary purpose, however, is to be a learning experience for myself so that I can increase my exposure to serverless computing.

There are three top-level directories, each with a different purpose:

* `passalong-back` is a Django based REST API deployed in a Lambda via Zappa
* `passalong-front` is a React based front end hosted in S3
* `infra` is a GeoEngineer/Terraform setup for building out the ancillary AWS infrastructure for the project

# Demo

Until I get a domain, http://passalong-front.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ is the place to go.

# Usage

Install:

* Ruby
* Python 3 and Pipenv
* Node
* Terraform

Run `bundle` from the top-level directory in order to download GeoEngineer and Rake.

Configure `~/.aws/credentials`.

## Setting up project dependencies

I'm using Node, Ruby, and Python for this project. For convenience's sake, I wrote a rake task to help with installing dependencies using the package manager for each language.

* `rake project:dependencies`

## Setting up the infrastructure:

* Check to see if the plan is to your liking with `rake infra:plan`
* Deploy your infrastructure with `rake infra:deploy`

## Deploying the frontend:

A rake task to package and deploy the frontend assets to S3.

* `rake frontend:deploy`

## Deploying the backend:

A rake task to deploy the Django app to a Lambda via Zappa.

* `rake backend:deploy`
